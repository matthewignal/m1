Midterm project for PHYS 2200

Calculates Pi using Leibniz series and Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe series

Includes printing of the number of terms in the series and the absolute error of the result
Iterations stop when absolute error is less than 10^-6

Includes measurement of time per function call for both functions
