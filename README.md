Midterm project for PHYS 2200

Calculates Pi using Leibniz series and Bailey-Borwein-Plouffe series

Includes printing of the number of terms in the series and the absolute error of the result

Iterations stop when absolute error is less than 10^-6

Precision of time measurement is increased by repeating function calls multiple times so that the total running time is between 1 and 2 seconds

Includes measurement of time per function call for both functions as well as the ratio of Leibniz calculation to BBP calculation
